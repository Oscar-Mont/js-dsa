# js-dsa

This repo consists on notes taken while learning data structures and algorithms with JavaScript. 

Each directory has a text file with notes and a .js file with the algorithm solution I implemented
during my learning process. 

This is for future reference for myself but is public for anyone to check if they find it useful.
